# CBB520 Assignment
## Author: Devang Thakkar

The repository here contains the code written for the assignment. The python script script_cbb520.py contains all the functions written for the purpose of the assignment. I have used Django to serve up the code with a visual GUI. The template for the Django server has been adapted based on  the tutorial [How to Render Django Form Manually](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/article/2017/08/19/how-to-render-django-form-manually.html)
